In the case of an active shooter or hostage situation, the bomb squad would bring Spot on site, with the Autowalk mission file selected and the robot charged up and ready to conduct an initial sweep. Each member of the bomb squad can operate Spot and the team brings the robot out on every call, whether it's needed or not. 

"We have a robot that we could bring out to a scene and have it 100 percent capable of doing what we want to do immediately, instead of having to set things up," said Stewart. "Just like a regular K-9, we take it out of the truck and it's ready to go."
 
Stewart says the bomb squad doesn't take Spot to many public relations events, preferring to maintain a low profile. Their focus is on continuing to put Spot through its paces, mapping more buildings and being ready to respond to any high risk call.

Spot's successful deployment in Montgomery County is just one example of its versatility in the field of public safety. Whether inspecting suspicious packages, searching for accident victims, or inspecting toxic drug labs, Spot is enabling law enforcement and emergency responders around the world to gather insight and evidence efficiently, while keeping themselves and civilians out of harm's way.

"It's a remarkable tool," said Stewart. "We're just trying to take advantage of everything that we possibly can with it."
