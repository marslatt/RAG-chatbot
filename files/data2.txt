A robotic dog named "Spot" created by Boston Dynamics  is the latest tool in the arsenal of the US Secret Service.

The device has lately been spotted patrolling the perimeter of President-elect Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.

They do not have weapons - and each can be controlled remotely or automatically - as long as its route is pre-programmed.

Passers-by are warned by a sign on each of Spot’s legs: "DO NOT PET."

"I don't know that anyone is tempted to pet these robot dogs. They do not look cuddly," said Melissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College.

Video of Spot strutting around the property has gone viral on TikTok - where reactions range from calling them cool and cute, to creepy - and become fodder for jokes on American late night television. But its mission is no laughing matter.
